# RobertoTeleop
This is a module to teleoperate Roberto. Roberto is a rover I've been developping since a few years ago until forever. It is an experimental platform to test sensors, robotic parts and other toys.

The robot is currently controlled by a RaspberryPi as main computer and an Arduino Mega as low-level driver.
Here you can find a module for the RaspberryPi that allows Roberto to be teleoperated.

The communication with the master is set via Wifi.

The communication with the driver (https://github.com/Butakus/RobertoDriver) is set via Serial port.
